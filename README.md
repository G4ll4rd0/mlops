## Introduction

MLOps is an emerging discipline that combines machine learning (ML) with DevOps practices to enhance the deployment, monitoring, and management of machine learning models. This project serves as a hands-on guide to explore MLOps principles and tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MLOps-Basics-Learning-Project.git
   cd MLOps-Basics-Learning-Project
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```

## Key Concepts

1. **Version Control for Data and Models**: Learn how to track changes in datasets and models using Git and DVC.
2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Understand how to set up CI/CD pipelines for your ML models.
3. **Model Monitoring**: Explore techniques for monitoring model performance in production.
4. **Automated Testing**: Implement tests to ensure model reliability and performance.
5. **Collaboration**: Discover how to facilitate collaboration between data scientists and engineers.
